Description:
	The dbNSFP is an integrated database of functional annotations from multiple 
	sources for the comprehensive collection of human non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNVs). 
	Its current version includes a total of 84,013,490 nsSNVs and ssSNVs (splice site
	SNVs). It compiles prediction scores from 32 prediction algorithms (SIFT, SIFT4G, 
	Polyphen2-HDIV, Polyphen2-HVAR, LRT, MutationTaster2, MutationAssessor, FATHMM, MetaSVM, 
	MetaLR, CADD, VEST4, PROVEAN, FATHMM-MKL coding, FATHMM-XF coding, fitCons, LINSIGHT, 
	DANN, GenoCanyon, Eigen, Eigen-PC, M-CAP, REVEL, MutPred, MVP, MPC, PrimateAI, GEOGEN2, BayesDel, 
	ClinPred, LIST-S2, ALoFT), 9 conservation scores (bStatistic, phyloP100way_vertebrate, 
	phyloP30way_mammal, phyloP17way_primate, phastCons100way_vertebrate, phastCons30way_mammal, 
	phastCons17way_primate, GERP++ and SiPhy) and other function annotations. 
	Since version 2.0, dbNSFP is separated into two parts, dbNSFP_variant and 
	dbNSFP_gene. As their names indicate, the former focuses on variant annotations 
	(including prediction scores and conservation scores), and the latter focuses on 
	gene annotations.
	Since version 2.6, dbscSNV is added as an attached database, which includes all 
	potential human SNVs within splicing consensus regions (−3 to +8 at the 5’ splice site 
	and −12 to +2 at the 3’ splice site), i.e. scSNVs, and predictions for their potential 
	of altering splicing. 
	Since version 3, two branches of dbNSFP are provided: "a" branch is suitable for academic use, 
	which includes all the resources, and "c" branch is suitable for commercial use, which does not 
	include Polyphen2, VEST, REVEL, CADD, LINSIGHT, GenoCanyon.

	on the Polyphen-2 annotations have been updated too.

	April 11, 2012: dbNSFP2.0b1_variant released. This is beta test version of the variant sub-database 
	of dbNSFP v2.0, which is rebuilt based on Gencode release 9 / Ensembl version 64.

	June 2, 2012: dbNSFP v2.0b2 released. It includes both the dbNSFP_variant and dbNSFP_gene sub-databases. 
	Slight changes have been made to the Ensembl gene and transcript ids of dbNSFP_variant in order to be 
	compatible to other database sources.

	July 2, 2012: dbNSFP v2.0b3 released. An additional 2.2 million splicing site SNPs have been added to 
	dbNSFP_variant. In the table those SNPs have missing (".") in aaref, aaalt and "-1" in aapos. There's 
	no change to the format of search input file.

	August 28, 2012: The companion java search program search_dbNSFP20b3 is updated. Added features include 
	supporting vcf file as input file and options for output contents (columns).

	October 27, 2012: dbNSFP v2.0b4 is released. A new functional prediction score MutationAssessor is added 
	(I thank Mr. Yevgeniy Antipin for his recommendation). Allele frequencies from ESP 5400 data set are 
	replaced by ESP 6500 data set.

	February 25, 2013: dbNSFP v2.0 is released. A new functional prediction score FATHMM is added.

	March 22, 2013: A bug which caused a lot of missing FATHMM scores has been fixed.  

	May 31, 2013: The source code of the companion Java search program is now available under the RECEX SHARED 
	SOURCE LICENSE.

	October 3, 2013: dbNSFP v2.1 is released. MutationTaster and FATHMM scores have been updated. Converted 
	scores of SIFT, LRT, MutationTaster, MutationAssessor and FATHMM have been added. Columns of SIFT and FATHMM 
	predictions have been added. The gene database has also been updated. Database IDs are updated. GO Slim terms, 
	pathway and protein interaction information from the ConsensusPathDB, and list of essential and non-essential 
	genes (based on phenotypes of mouse homologs) have been added.

	January 23, 2014: dbNSFP v2.2 is released. SIFT and FATHMM now have multiple scores corresponding to different 
	Ensembl ENSP ids and amino acid positions (aapos_SIFT and aapos_FATHMM). Accordingly, our companion search 
	program now supports SNP searches based on Ensembl ENSP ids and amino acid positions. A bug is fixed for a 
	small proportion of MutationTaster scores.

	January 26, 2014: dbNSFP v2.3 is released.  Two ensemble scores (RadialSVM and LR) and their predictions have 
	been added.

	February 12, 2014: A bug was fixed in dbNSFP v2.2 and v2.3, which caused missing delimiters in columns 
	aapos_SIFT, SIFT_score_converted and SIFT_pred. (I thank Mr. Yevgeniy Antipin for his reminder). 

	March 5, 2014: dbNSFP v2.4 is released. A whole genome functional prediction score called CADD was added, 
	along with five more conservation scores (phyloP46way_primate, phyloP100way_vertebrate, phastCons46way_primate, 
	phastCons46way_placental, phastCons100way_vertebarate). To facilitate comparison between scores, we added rank 
	scores for most functional prediction scores and conservation scores, and replacing the  "converted" scores in 
	the previous versions.

	June 1, 2014: dbNSFP v2.5 is released. A new functional score VEST 3.0 has been added. We thank Dr. Karchin for 
	kindly providing the score. A bug that causes the MutationTaster score error since v2.1 for variants with a 
	prediction of  "Polymorphism_automatic" has been fixed. We thank John McGuigan and James Ireland for reporting 
	this bug. As MutationTaster can also predict splicing change and other functional effects, in case a variant has 
	multiple predictions based on their different model, we took the most damaging score and prediction for dbNSFP. 
	
	July 26, 2014: dbNSFP v2.6 is released. rs numbers from dbSNP 141 have been added to the variant database files. 
	Mouse and zebra fish homolog genes and phenotypes have been added to the gene database file (I thank Alex Li for
	his suggestion and helps). Trait_association(GWAS) was also updated. An attached database called dbscSNV is 
	available for download. It includes all potential human SNVs within splicing consensus regions (−3 to +8 at the 
	5’ splice site and −12 to +2 at the 3’ splice site), i.e. scSNVs, related functional annotations and two ensemble 
	prediction scores for predicting their potential of altering splicing. A manuscript describing those scores have 
	been submitted. search_dbNSFP26 now supports searching dbNSFP along with dbscSNV using option "-s". 
	
	September 12, 2014: dbNSFP v2.7 is released. Chromosomes and positions of human reference hg38 have been added. 
	search_ dbNSFP27.class now supports query dbNSFP using the positions based on hg38 with the "-v hg38" option. 
	clinvar (freeze 20140902) annotations have been added. Allele frequencies from 2303 exomes of African Americans 
	and 3203 exomes of European Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) cohort study 
	have been added. As the columns for gene interactions in dbNSFP_gene table contain very long strings, especially 
	for gene UBC, which may cause problems when viewing the results in Excel, now we only report the number of 
	interacting genes in those columns. Full information is retained in the dbNSFP_gene.complete table.
	
	November 21, 2014:  dbNSFP v2.8 is released. COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) annotation have 
	been added. Pathway information from BioCarta and KEGG (old version) has been added to the dbNSFP2.8_gene. A bug 
	causing inconsistency between MutationTaster scores and MutationTaster_pred, which affects v2.5 to v2.7, has 
	been fixed. I thank Adam Novak for reporting this bug.
	
	February 3, 2015: dbNSFP v2.9 is released. SIFT score has been updated to ensembl66 version. PROVEAN score 
	(Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) v1.1 has been added. I thank Yongwook Choi from jcvi for providing the SIFT 
	and PROVEAN scores. CADD score has been updated to 1.3 version. Please note the following copyright statement 
	for CADD: "CADD scores (http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/) are Copyright 2013 University of Washington and 
	Hudson-Alpha Institute for Biotechnology (all rights reserved) but are freely available for all academic, 
	non-commercial applications. For commercial licensing information contact Jennifer McCullar (mccullaj@uw.edu)."
	Allele frequency v0.3 of ~60,706 unrelated individuals from The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) has been added. 
	ExAC data are released under a Fort Lauderdale Agreement. Please refer to http://exac.broadinstitute.org/terms 
	for terms of use. I also want to thank Dr. CS (Jonathan) Liu from Softgenetics for providing hosting space.
	
	April 6, 2015: dbNSFP v3.0b1 is released. The core set of nsSNVs and ssSNVs has been rebuilt based on Gencode 22/
	Ensembl 79 with human reference sequence hg38. Putative genes have been included. Genes with incomplete 5' have
	been excluded (I thank Chris Gillies for reporting the issues for genes with incomplete 5' end.) Genes on 
	mitochondrial DNA have been included. Allele frequencies from the UK10K cohorts and genotypes of two Neanderthals 
	have been added. Some resources have been updated, including the MutationTaster (I thank Dr. Dominik Seelow 
	for kindly providing the scores), allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project populations, ancestral alleles, 
	dbSNP, ClinVar and InterPro. The presentation of the prediction scores has been improved by adding columns for 
	the corresponding transcript/protein ids. PhyloP and PhastCons conservation scores based on hg19 have been 
	replaced by the scores based on hg38. Some resources have been dropped due to various reasons, including SLR 
	test statistic, UniSNP ids, allele frequencies from the ARIC cohorts and allele counts in COSMIC. dbNSFP_gene 
	has also been completely rebuilt using the up-to-date resources. Residual Variation Intolerance Scores (RVIS) 
	have been added. GO Slim terms have been replaced by full GO terms. Two branches of dbNSFP are now provided:
	dbNSFP3.0b1a suitable for academic use, which includes all the resources, and dbNSFP3.0b1c suitable for commercial 
	use, which does not include VEST3 and CADD. 
	
	April 12, 2015: dbNSFP v3.0b2 is released. This update fixed the issues due to inconsistent mitochondrial reference
	sequences used by different resources. I thank Dr. Lishuang Shen at MEEI for helping solving the issues. For 
	mitochondrial SNV, the pos (i.e. hg38) refers to the rCRS (GenBank: NC_012920) and hg19_pos refers to a YRI 
	sequence (GenBank: AF347015). The ancestral allele of mitochondrial SNV now comes from the Reconstructed Sapiens 
	Reference Sequence (RSRS, doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.03.002). The affected content include ancestral alleles, 
	Neanderthal/Denisova genotypes and MutationTaster columns of the chrM file. The rankscores of MutationTaster has
	also been updated to reflect the update of its chrM scores. dbscSNV has been updated to v1.1 and added hg38 
	positions liftovered from its hg19 positions. Using search_dbNSFP30b2a or search_dbNSFP30b2c you can search 
	dbscSNV1.1 along with dbNSFP v3.0b2 with either hg19 coordinates or hg38 coordinates.
	
	August 3, 2015: dbNSFP v3.0 is released. Three new functional prediction scores (DANN, fathmm-MKL and fitCons) and
	two conservation scores (phyloP20way_mammalian and phastCons20way_mammalian) have been added to dbNSFP v3.0a. 
	All five scores except DANN are also included in bNSFP v3.0c. For commercial application of DANN, please contact 
	Daniel Quang (dxquang@uci.edu). CADD scores have been updated to v1.3. I thank Dr. Xueqiu Jian and Kirill Prusov for 
	suggestions on README files. dbNSFP v3.0 will be integrated into our new whole genome annotation pipeline WGSA version
	0.6. Please join our Email group for news and updates from dbNSFP. 
	Columns updated: CADD_raw (dbNSFP v3.0a only), CADD_raw_rankscore (dbNSFP v3.0a only), CADD_phred (dbNSFP v3.0a only).

	December 5, 2019: A minor bug is fixed in dbNSFP v4.0. In the previous release the content of the following columns were compressed, 
	i.e. if annotations for all transcripts are identical, only one annotation was presented: genename, cds_strand, refcodon, codonpos, 
	codon_degeneracy, FATHMM_score, FATHMM_pred, Interpro_domain. In this release those columns are decompressed, i.e. have the same
	number of annotations as the number of transcripts. A Java-based graphic user interface (GUI) search program (search_dbNSFP40a.jar or 
	search_dbNSFP40c.jar) has been added. Users can double-click the jar file to launch the GUI (it supports commandline also, please
	check the search_dbNSFP readme pdf for details).
